        <p>
          I have always been technology obsessed and I love that my growth in
          technology includes growing in the development of a variety of Apps.
          During my learning I have come to realize the flexibility and power of
          the web. I am a developer in full stack web applications (certified by
          the University of Toronto) and am continuing my journey in learning
          AWS and python. This page is a dedication to my use of effects with
          HTML and CSS only.

          <h2>The Gap</h2>
          <p>Student and Helping Family</p>
          <p>
            Due to an older family member having an accident, that was luckily
            not debilitating, they decided it was time to retire. The issue
            being that there was 30 years of accumulated auto-parts and cars
            that had to be removed from the leased land. I was principle in
            seeing this accomplished during the day while attending class in C#
            at Centennial College at the progress Campus at night.
          </p>
          <p>August 2017 to Nov 2019</p>
          <p>During this time:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>100% grade in my class in C#</li>
            <li>Removal of over 100 inoperable cars</li>
            <li>
              Removal of $60,000 of steel parts that were stored in 7 truck
              bodies and had to be moved to a metal bin
            </li>
            <li>
              Removal of all chemicals that are associated with auto-mechanics
              to an authorized disposal site
            </li>
            <li>Returned the site to the landlord meeting all criteria</li>

          <h2>Gatestone & Co.</h2>
          <p>
            Gatestone & Co. is a 3rd party contact center normally specializing
            in debt collection services. The company had managed to negotiate a
            contract with the streaming platform Shomi. We were to provide
            technical and billing support across Phone, Social and Chat. Despite
            the supervisor position being earmarked for internal transfers the
            client chose me to to be the lead supervisor for Shomi member
            services. Due to my cross-platform knowledge and technical expertise
            gained across previous roles.
          </p>

            <strong>Floor Supervisor </strong>- Shomi Member services: Feb 2020
            to Aug 2023

          <p>As the Floor Supervisor I led my team to acheive:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Quality adherence above 80%</li>
            <li>

              month mark despite other platforms coming online.
